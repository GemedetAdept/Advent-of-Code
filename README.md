Programs made for the 12 challenges of Advent of Code 2025

All of these programs are likely to be a hot mess, but if they work, they work.

I would also like to add that I am aware of the many libraries already written for Fortran 90 to massively expand its capabilites. However, in order to better understand the language and to keep my problem-solving sharp, I decided that part of the challenge for me was to write any functions I might need that aren't intrinsic.

> Note: Yes, the intrinsic functions, keywords, types, etc. are all in caps. I also know that this goes directly against common style guides and most people dislike it.
>
> *Counterpoint:* I recognize that the style guide has made a decision, but given that I personally like the look of the caps, I've elected to ignore it.
